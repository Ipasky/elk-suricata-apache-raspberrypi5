# ELK system to colect logs from Suricata IDS and Apache2 HTTP Server on Raspberry Pi 5

This repository is a tutorial for everyone who wants to install an ELK system on a Raspberry Pi 5, to collect logs from your local network devices through Suricata IDS and data logs from your Apache2 web service. 

I want to achieve this project because I had the intention to allocate in my home network a web page opened to the internet. Giving public access to your local network is kind of dangerous and exposes your devices, for that reason I built this monitoring setup, trying to minimize my response time in case of a security breach, and although to practice and learn about new technologies.
